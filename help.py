        Some basic rules of the program:

        Create a file first in order to access other features
        such as editing or viewing a File

        You can only write one line when creating a File.
        To add more, go to "edit a file" to add one line at a time.

        You can not have two files with the same name.
        New file created with the same name will overwrite the existing
        file's contents.

        When entering a file name, the name should be matching the
        letter case of the file.""")
